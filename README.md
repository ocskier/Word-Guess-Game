### Instructions

* This is a random word generating game where the user tries to guess the word 
from the displayed category.

* The game will generate a random word string from one of the four categories selected from the dropdown menu (default is World Counties).

* The game will erase the contents of the answer, letters guessed list, current letter selected, and the number of guesses remaining upon a reset, or win, or loss of the game.

* The game will draw an appropiate size answer box and give the user the length + five guesses.

* The user must click one of the letters of the alphabet as a guess and then the program determines if its in the word, deduct one guess, and display it if its in the word or not.

* If the word is guesses correctly it will alert won or lost and play a tune, then reset the game.

* The game can be reset or the category changed at anytime and generate a new word.

* Have fun!
